I've used TADA for a few months now and it is cheaper than grab 98% of the time. The only trick (as taught by the TADA drivers themselves) is to pay for your ride with cash as this attracts more drivers to you.

98% seems quite ridiculous, unless you only ride during surge. I just checked and tada is $5 more ex than grab. Nevertheless, competition is good, always good to have both apps to compare prices.

I had only experienced 3 different occasions where TADA was more expensive, one of it being this morning to work (28 on TADA vs 26 on grab). Maybe I've been really lucky idk but I do use TADA even when grab isn't surging. Totally agree with you about competition!

Any reason why?

Is it simply because they don't have to wait for Tada to payout at end of the fortnight or the month or...?

Kay Woo, the founder of MVL Foundation, said the company was not seeking profits.

Cannot be leh. That means it will probably get bought over by Grab/Comfort

Why not? Lots of big startups donâ€™t look to be profitable for years. They aim to grow in revenue and customer base until they hit critical mass, then profitability comes in afterwards. Many top startups lose money for years and years.

That's why we need to enjoy TADA before they reach that stage where they start monetizing like mad. Seriously, fuck the advertising screen Grab is now putting in the back seats.

Nowadays the rule had changed. Market share is everything. No profit? Well, just look at Amazon.com and Netflix in the early days. No money to run business? No problem, just find and use OPM. Customers is your product.

I just realised that TADA has already taken the first step towards misleading the public.

When I first read "MVL Foundation, said the company was not seeking profits", I thought they had incorporated as a non-profit. A quick check on iTunes shows that their company name is "MVL Foundation Pte. Ltd.".

(ACRA seems to have approved their name, but I maintain that it's pretty misleading.)

Actual non-profits (i.e. real foundations) can't be acquired by private companies. So yeah, I guess an acquisition by Grab seems inevitable.

Depends on what kind of data.

They will most likely know my traveling scheudle, how traffic flows etc.

If they are selling this data for the sake of cheaper prices. I don't mind

This is my wishful thinking too. Maybe in Singapore we're more open to personal data mining as opposed to the Americans. But we can never really know what kind of data is being used, who it is being sold to, and for what purpose.

Yeap I agree. For example if the traffic data is being sold to SMRT to help them plan better routes and timing then good.

But perhaps the data can be used for other motives for eg. criminal activities.

I think the recent case with Cambridge Analytica was that the information was used for political purposes. As long as the right laws are in place and monitoring is evident I don't see any issue with having anonymous data being provided to firms

It's not like Cambridge Analytica can use that data for campaigns in this country anyway - our electoral campaigning seasons are far from competitive.

Tada is slightly more expensive for my usual routes during non-peak if you compared against grab. $24 v $27

During peak tada quoted $25 and Grab was $37.

Tada is the anti-surge option imo.

Cheaper than CDG slightly. (Need to factor in CDG booking fees too)

Well in order to open more revenue streams, they have to diversify. And itâ€™s the best time to do so as they have no competition for car rides, so they can channel money made from there to kill any other competitors in the other business units.

Diverisifying is only good if it's done well.

Idk how well Grab Cycle or Grab Food or Grab Whatever is doing. They're making a lot of big movements such as partnering with McDonald's but it remains to be seen if they'll get their money back.

No idea if their other business units are making money. But grab has raised a ton of money (billions) and is primed to be a major player.

I canâ€™t find any info on Grabs earnings. They do give a figure on how much revenue generated.. but profit and loss got no info.

I guess their main product now is the data and grabpay. Thatâ€™s the reason last time they keep pushing grabpay, so can lock down the money for other purposes.

GrabFood is amazing; being one of the only(?) food delivery apps that do not require a minimum purchase, just delivery fees. Very practical for a single person's orders, unlike other apps where its more practical for campus groups studying together or small offices when it's raining (like today).

Interesting that one selling point is the less volatile pricing.

If we think back, one original selling point of Uber when it just entered the sg market was its "dynamic pricing" to better balance supply and demand compared to the taxis' system of surcharges. The latter wasn't really working that well, with poor availability just before midnight when the surcharges kick in.

Not a defence of Uber, grab or anything, just an observation that struck me when reading the article. More competition would do consumers good. And tada does seem to have an innovative business model where it aims to get profits from data instead of commissions. Presumably this is how it can sustainably offer lower fares - if the lower fares are from burning investor cash to subsidize consumers, it won't last.

I personally didn't mind Uber's surge pricing because I was always guaranteed a ride within 3 minutes. Grab can go pound sand with drivers ignoring my request for half an hour, or to add insult to injury their drivers can cancel my shit willy-nilly because they feel like it.

Charge me a premium for guaranteed good service, and I'll jolly well pay for it. It's for the same reason I pay $48/month for the Financial Times instead of ST's $15.

"Less volatile" doesn't work during surge unless the drivers are being subsidised by the company. If I was a driver I'd just switch to Grab when it's raining / when there's high demand, exacerbating the situation.

And it's highly unlikely that TADA can beat Grab in a price war, so this promise can only hurt TADA in the long-run.

I am not sure how much cheaper it can be long-term. All those apps take a commission and give the rest to the driver. There is gonna be a limit to how low drivers are willing to drive for.
