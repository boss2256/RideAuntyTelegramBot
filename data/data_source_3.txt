Is it just me or has Grab become more ridiculous nowadays?
Question
From promo codes that you can’t use most of the time (except for the rare ones), to 3 mins waiting time, to crazy expensive fares with almost 50% peak prices…

I think it’s becoming a bit ridiculous.

Or it is just me?

Same same unless it’s really no choice or urgent and comfort cannot help in my case.

The prices are high, waiting time getting worst.

But at a stage where taking mrt and bus makes sense. Plenty of games and books to read on the mobile

Whenever I've needed to take a taxi now, I use Tada or CDG. Fares are far cheaper 90% of the time, but still more expensive than I was used to paying for similar routes.

It's very likely that the companies have used data to determine what your breaking point is. I checked right now, from my home to a location in CBD, Tada is 15, CDG is 14-17 by meter, Grab is 21, and Gojek 24. I used grab a lot earlier because I signed up for their subscription beta where they gave me 10% discount if I used grab pay as the payment method. Maybe that's why I'm seeing grab as higher.

They have it all figured out:

As annoying as surge pricing may be to people, Uber knows that you are likely to pay the price at certain times. In fact, Uber even knows what your phone battery is currently and can determine if you are likely to pay or not

Yep, same as well.

Grab has always been cheaper for me, comparing with Gojek/Tada/Comfort.

Especially during peak hours, it will always be a few dollars cheaper than the rest.

I'm wondering if it's affected by location...

I was scrolling the responses here thought I’m the only one who finds grab cheaper than Gojek and CDG. Most of the times, these two more expensive than Grab. Gojek likes to give me drivers all the way from the airport. I stay around Tampines.

I think we got used to it being so cheap and filled with discounts but we need to understand that in the earlier years, the companies were throwing money at people in order to grab market share.

Now that they are listed on NASDAQ, they are under pressure to at least slow down the damn burn rate.

So the reality is that the rates of the past will never come back and the platform is essentially a supply-demand chain. There's a reason why traditional taxis charge what they do. You may think that grab and all the new tech have discovered some major gap in the market and but there is only so much profit margin there to squeeze.

None of the above is within your control, but having an understanding of the circumstances will help you to reconcile the current situation and think objectively.

On an individual level, i just download all the other apps and do a once off when i need to get transport. Here's a quick breakdown of the various apps +s and -s from my own anecdotal experience:

Grab: almost always available and generally their drivers will get to you the fastest.

Gojek: tends to be cheaper than grab during peak hours, but the drivers tend to be further away so if you are late for a meeting, i wouldnt rely on gojek.

Comfort: similar to gojek, slightly closer drivers in general. During super peak, their meter rates tend to be cheaper(but of course taxi drivers can take you on the scenic route also)

Ryde,Tata: almost always cheaper if you have time to wait around for prices to be affordable, but wait times are extremely inconsistent.

Also, our public transport is really not bad at all. Give it a chance if you will.

Im not beyond calling out when companies are shit. And grab is a pretty shitty business if you look at how they treat their "partners".

That said, I generally think people should at least try to understand why certain things are instead of just complaining by default.

Nowadays, people just look for comfortable echo chambers where everyone just psych each other up and you lose the ability to be objective because if everyone agrees with me, i must be right, RIGHT?

This.

Grab (and friends) are private companies, not public services. We’ve gotten used to cheap VC money allowing tech companies to provide services that have changed the way we go about our lives (for both better and worse). This isn’t and was never sustainable.

The pain is just us adjusting back to reality.

Objectively yes this makes sense.

However, I find Grab’s PR pretty poor. The way they communicate any changes or new initiatives always come off as “too bad suck it up”. Eg when they announced reducing the wait time to 3min.

If they knew their low prices couldn’t sustain forever, they could’ve anticipated the negative response and find ways to soften the blow too.

Sometimes people do choose the more expensive option because of good branding or perhaps just goodwill. Eg buying Starbucks coffee. Or maybe your absolute favourite caifan uncle bopian has to raise prices but you still choose to support his store cos he was always nice to you and generous with his portions.

Overall I think they just never managed to build a more approachable image, which compounds the situation. You need to build a positive relationship with your consumers during good times so when shit happens, the reaction is not as terrible.

I completely agree. I think they are a shitty business ran by a rich boy(anthony is heir to tan chong motors) with a harvard business degree.

But my post was about dealing with the reality of the situation, not a post mortem of grab's business model and/or ethics.

Like i said, getting angry about it is not gonna make a difference to them. Think about it, they barely even cared when their share price tanked from $10 to $2, they're burning more than a billion bucks a quarter. A company like that will only care when their biggest funders pull out.

And i feel like getting frustrated about this is a damn boliao exercise.

The frustration is partly due to their bad PR, hence my response. We are humans after all and it’s understandable that our opinions are affected by emotions too.

It’s unrealistic to expect their whole consumer base to react based on objective facts alone. That’s not how it works.

Lol my man, we're gonna go in circles. You're conflating too many things.

And that's exactly the point of my reply - that having an understanding of why this is happening will help reconcile the situation and help you think more objectively. I'm not here to change your mind or skew your biases, i just found that when I understood things beyond how it affects me, I'm generally less grumpy and move on faster, hence my reply. I'm perfectly aware it wont work for everyone, but hey, differing perspectives can coexist.

On that note, I think we generall agree, so let's move on. Have a good weekend!

I'm done with Grab. Have been done since they hiked up the price to 'improve driver earnings' which doesn't really improve anything except their own revenue.

Decided there's really no point letting a company like that earn my money, and have since found joy in taking public transport. Fast, efficient, and cruising down the bus lane during peak hours while the cars are all jammed up is just.. quite shiok.

If the price doesn’t come down, it’s simply because enough other customers are willing to pay for rides, and/or there aren’t enough drivers around. Not everything is “A SCAM!!!” especially when you were willing to wait (but evidently not long enough).

Not just you. Reason is because of a lack of drivers. When restrictions eased, demand for ride hailing came back very quickly, but drivers that quit during the pandemic are not coming back to drive. This is made worse with the sky rocketing petrol costs. You end up with so little drivers that there is perpetually a shortage, resulting in forever surge pricing and being matched with drivers that are far away.

If you look at Grab's recent move of shortening waiting time to 3 minutes, it is a very obvious move to pander to the drivers to boost retention. At this point of time, they need the drivers more than passengers.

The key is not to use solely Grab, GOjek or Comfort. You should check all the different apps before booking the best price.

I’m sure 1min of checking is reasonable given that you’re gon be spending 15-20 for a typical trip anyways.

I mean it has always been pretty expensive..... especially with sevices like getgo and bluesg. If you have a license. It genuinely doesn't make sense to grab for the most part.

For example, for me to grab home from camp (i NSF), It costs about $15-22. That price is what grab shows for right now.

Compared to if i just drove home with bluesg. It costs me around $7-10 depending on how fast i want to drive. I mean yea lah theres an $8 monthly subscription fee, but even if you count that in, it'll still be cheaper when you average out per month.

Somemore no waiting time for the most part.

Then if you going out with friends or something, even cheaper. Like when i in bmt everytime book out, i drive my bunkmates home (got 4 of us stayed nearby). 4 people average cost is $4/person. But they usually just each pay 1 extra dollar as service fee for me since i driver. So basically free ride. Plus for them they not losing anything also $5 still fking cheap.

The eta on the app is never correct some drivers even have the audacity not to move cos they don't want to pick you up and can make you wait for them.

actually it really depends on timing also! sometimes grab can really be cheaper but before i book a ride i always compare between grab (sometimes give 20% off), gojek (now they have 3$ off to malls), ryde (always cheaper idk why but hard to find), comfort, and tada.

i ALWAYS compare all before i book cause i kiasu af :’) for grab try to use grab hitch its really worth

There is comfort and Gojek. Grab is expensive because everyone and their uncle want to ride but everyone and their uncle don’t want to drive.

Gojek is marginally cheaper, and comfort simply uses a different chart because they’re regulated. Good luck getting a cab in busy hours.

I just did a check on the prices to get to work.

Tada is cheapest at 29

Grab is 2nd at 31

Your precious CDG who you don't ever want to have a monopoly again is 37

Gojek is at 40.

It's almost like the prices are dependent on the situation and all.

Just use all the apps and stop complaining so much.

IT HAS! Also it's started introducing a minimum order fee like Foodpanda, which I boycott for that very reason. Ridiculous. Now I only ever use it to pay to get points and cashback on my job absolute cashback card.

I usually compare prices from both grab and cdg zig if I need to take a car. Usually end up paying $30+ though

Grab has always been ridiculous. Don't forget they used to do all kinds of shady things when they first started, like sending gangsters on fake trips with competitor's drivers and trying to recruit them, as well as having a department of thugs serving as investigation officers interrogating their drivers for small issues.

I had a ride at $30, but I put the wrong location. Changed location it became $43, so technically I’d just have to top up $13 to go through, right? Not to grab, i had to topup $43 to go through and they only gave me back my $30 after the ride. Wtf is this bs.

To clarify for the high pricing: it was heavy rain and I had to get to a interview that’s 1 hour away if I’m going by public transport. My main concern is the UX, why couldnt the $13 just be enough for it to go through?

Grab uncle told me...

rising car prices

rising fuel prices

lesser drivers

alot of the initial drivers came from COVID retrenchments. Now they have found stable jobs and are/have already re entered full time roles

Low supply of drivers, consistent demand from passengers means high prices for consumers

I was on a cab from a guy who used to do Grab but switched to other platforms (I forgot what it was)

He told me that Grab treats their long time drivers like shit. They only value new drivers, giving them much more incentives than they would a long time driver. All of this price surging does absolutely nothing for them at all

They had a grab food promo that they claim gives u 30% discount. But there's a minimum amount that you'll have to spend and the discount is capped at $8. But $30 x 0.3 = $9 and $8 is a 26.667% discount. And as the amount you spent increases, the lesser the discount gets. They're basically making false claims

I work at Silicon Valley and moving to Singapore soon so here’s my take

All the tech companies that have gig economies as revenue drivers were simply not profitable before, aren’t now and will never be with the pricing models they’ve implemented for long and ones we are used to (affordable ones to riders). As the competition constricts the plan has always been to increase to offset their balance sheet bleeding red. The problem has been over the last few years esp with Covid years coming in (and also war which jacked up the fuel prices exponentially) they’ve needed to accelerate their need for upping their prices as they feel the pressure to deliver justification for the Wall Street, investors and stakeholders within the business to allow them continually being in the red other than “we are a tech company and this is a scalable app..” In short gig economy apps and businesses do not operate on a sustainable business model since all them are spiring down to having so much debt in the end that need to be financed (disaster), and all the while taking advantage of the main source of income which are their drivers taking their portion of income here and there and not providing basic necessary income model for them to be sustainable themselves — simple cost constriction on the app/business’s end (ask any driver and they are largely extremely unhappy with yield from their investment).

So understand why these price hikes or aggressive hikes and all the meanwhile SLA delivery quality being lowered are happening and they won’t stop in the future.

If you really want to help, just ride a taxi or MRT. Help uncles and aunties out, and invest in Singapore’s own infrastructure.

TLDR: all gig economies for the most part have shit business models that aren’t sustainable and prey on workers. Ride taxis or public transits. Your nights out can wait a bit lah.

You do know that peak prices are just the demand/supply curve in action?

Like if more people want to use it during peak hours, they’ve got to raise prices to make sure more people can get a Grab from place to place. It’s about getting people what they need while compensating the workers for it.

It’s moral from a utilitarian standpoint (more people get around on a grab during peak hours when they need it the most), and an individual standpoint (I can actually get a Grab, rather than waiting forever because Grab doesn’t allow price to increase for demand).

Could also be because they have lesser drivers on the road now. So the price/waiting time keeps going up.

Then again they could have adjusted their algorithm to take in these changes, but I guess they decided to let it run and see.

3 mins waiting is normal. We are supposed to wait for grab, not grab waiting for us. Just like your friend asked you for outing to meet him at 3pm. You went there at 2.55pm and your friend came at 3.30pm. That's not what we want.

Yes, expensive fare is unreasonable.

We can choose not to take grab. We take public transport.
